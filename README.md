# Optical Vegetation Indices (VIs) estimation
This code uses SAR data from Sentinel-1 to estimate optical VIs from Harmonized Landsat Sentinel data (HLS). To improve spatial transferability across different geographical regions, time-related variables such as growing degree days (GDD) and day of year (DOY) are evaluated. Model performance is also assessed at different crop growth stages.
